# Title: Introduction to Git and GitHub: Version Control, Collaboration, and Pull Requests

## What is Git?

Git: A Version Control System

### The Need for Git

#### Problem 1: Data Loss Due to System Crashes

Imagine you are coding on your computer, saving your work on the local hard disk. Unfortunately, a computer crash or a hard disk failure wipes out all your data. This is where Git comes into play.

#### Problem 2: Collaborative Coding Challenges

Consider a scenario where multiple individuals work on the same codebase. Each contributor has their version of the code, leading to time-consuming code exchange and merging processes.

#### Problem 3: Lack of Version Tracking

Standard computer systems lack built-in version tracking, leading to issues when managing different versions of files. A version control system, like Git, addresses these challenges.

### Solutions Provided by Git

1. **Cloud-Based Code Storage:** Version control systems save code on stable remote machines (the cloud). This guarantees code safety even if local systems fail.

2. **Efficient Collaboration:** In version control, a master copy of the code is maintained in the cloud. Contributors work on their copies, and the code merging process is streamlined using merge tools.

3. **Version Tracking:** Git tracks versions effectively. For instance, if you modify and save a file with a new version, Git ensures version consistency across files, reducing errors.

### Version Control Systems in the World

Various version control systems exist, such as Git, Mercurial, and Subversion. However, Git stands out as the most widely used, especially on GitHub.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub: Cloud-Based Code Hosting and Version Control

GitHub, a website, enables cloud-based code storage and is a comprehensive version control system powered by Git.

### Collaborative Contribution via GitHub

To contribute to your or others' code on GitHub:
1. Log in to your GitHub account, similar to accessing Gmail from different devices.
2. "Fork" the code repository â€“ a process of copying the code to your GitHub and local environment.

### The Fork-and-Modify Process

1. Software projects on GitHub are hosted by individuals or companies in repositories (repos).
2. To work on the code, fork the repo, which means copying it to your GitHub and local environment.
3. You can then modify and run the code, making improvements.
4. Save your changes to your GitHub repo and create a "pull request" to merge your changes with the original code.

### GitHub's Additional Features

- **Issue Tracking:** GitHub facilitates issue tracking to manage and resolve problems.
- **Wiki:** It enables the creation of code documentation.
- **Pulse and Graphs:** These features provide various statistics for better insights.

### Fascinating Facts

- GitHub boasts 14 million users and over 35 million repositories.
- The entirety of Linux's codebase is hosted on GitHub.

### Cloning Repositories and Basic Git Commands

- "Clone" means copying a repository from GitHub to your local machine using the command: `git clone [repository link]`.
- Use `git status` to check for changes.
- Adding files to the staging area is done with `git add`.
- Commit changes locally with `git commit`.
- Push changes to the remote server (GitHub) using `git push`.

### Handling Common Issues

- "Access Denied" issues can arise due to incorrect credentials; ensure proper GitHub profile settings.
- Use `git difftool` to compare local changes to previous versions.
- To undo changes, use `git checkout -- <file name>` or `git checkout -- .` for multiple files.

### Version Management and Pull Requests

- Compare changes between commits using `git difftool commit_id_1 commit_id_2` or shorthand like `HEAD~1`.
- A "detached HEAD" state occurs when `HEAD` doesn't point to the most recent commit.
- `.gitignore` can be used to ignore certain files.
  
## What is a Pull Request?

- A pull request is a mechanism on GitHub where code changes made by others can be shared with the repository owner.
- Collaborators can submit code modifications and request the owner to "pull" or merge their changes into the original repository.
